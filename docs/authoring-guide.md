# Authoring Markdown for OpenCrane Chunking

This guide describes how to structure markdown documentation so OpenCrane produces high-quality, retrievable chunks. It applies to `.md` source files authored for a docs site (Docusaurus, Nextra, plain markdown repos). It does **not** cover hand-authored `llms-full.txt` files.

## How Chunking Sees Your Markdown

When OpenCrane processes a markdown file, strategies are tried in order and the first match wins:

1. **YAML chunker** — claims fenced `yaml` and `yml` blocks, which OpenCrane takes out of the page before the other strategies run. A K8s CRD, OpenAPI spec, or JSON Schema goes to a tree walker for per-property chunking. Other nested YAML becomes one `yaml_content` chunk. A block of flat `key: value` pairs looks like front matter to this chunker, so it skips the block and the code chunker claims it.
2. **Code chunker** — claims the remaining fenced code blocks.
3. **Table chunker** — claims any section that contains a markdown table outside code fences. Emits one chunk per table data row and delegates the surrounding text to the list and prose chunkers.
4. **List chunker** — claims any section that contains markdown list markers outside code fences. Emits one chunk per top-level list item plus prose chunks for the text around the list.
5. **Prose chunker** — the catch-all. Splits text into chunks at heading boundaries.

Your authoring choices determine which strategy claims each piece of content and how well each chunk stands alone.

## Headings

Headings are the primary chunk boundary. Get them right and most chunking problems go away.

- **`#`, `##`, and `###` create chunk boundaries.** Everything between two such headings (inclusive of the opening heading) becomes one chunk.

  Example — this produces three chunks:

  ````md
  # Getting Started

  Installation instructions go here.

  ## Prerequisites

  Requirements go here.

  ## First Run

  First-run steps go here.
  ````

- **`####` and deeper do NOT split chunks.** Content under an `####` sub-heading stays embedded in the parent `###` chunk. Use `####+` deliberately for sub-structure you want retrieved *together with* the parent topic.

  Example — one chunk, not two:

  ````md
  ### Error Handling

  The client retries on transient errors.

  #### Retry policy

  Default is three retries with exponential backoff.
  ````

- **One focused topic per `##`/`###` section.** That section is one chunk; make sure everything a reader needs to understand the topic is inside it, including the opening heading (which gives the chunk its subject).

  Good:

  ````md
  ## Configuring the Retry Policy

  The retry policy controls how failed requests are re-attempted.
  Set `retries` and `backoff_ms` in `config.yaml` to tune behavior.
  ````

  Avoid (one chunk covers four unrelated topics — a search for "retry policy" or
  "authentication" retrieves this whole blob and the answer is buried inside it):

  ````md
  ## Configuration

  Set `retries` and `backoff_ms` to tune retry behavior.
  Set `request_timeout_ms` for timeouts.
  Auth tokens go in `auth.token`. Log level is set via `log_level`.
  ````

  Better — four focused chunks, each retrievable on its own:

  ````md
  ## Retry policy

  Set `retries` and `backoff_ms` in `config.yaml` to tune how failed
  requests are re-attempted.

  ## Request timeouts

  Set `request_timeout_ms` to control how long the client waits before
  aborting a request.

  ## Authentication

  Provide your API token via `auth.token` in `config.yaml`.

  ## Logging

  Set `log_level` to `debug`, `info`, or `warn` to control log verbosity.
  ````

- **Lead every page with an `#` title.** It starts the breadcrumb of every prose chunk on the page.

  Good:

  ````md
  # Database Migrations

  ## Running a migration
  ...
  ````

  Avoid (no `#` title, so OpenCrane uses the first heading, "Running a migration", as the page title. A retrieval result gives no indication that this is about database migrations rather than data migrations or network migrations):

  ````md
  ## Running a migration
  ...
  ````

- **Never indent content under an `##`/`###` with a deeper heading you plan to retrieve separately.** If it deserves its own chunk, promote it to `###`.

  Avoid (`#### Rotating keys` will be buried inside the parent chunk):

  ````md
  ## Authentication

  #### Rotating keys

  Keys must be rotated every 90 days.
  ````

  Good:

  ````md
  ## Authentication
  ...

  ### Rotating keys

  Keys must be rotated every 90 days.
  ````

- **The prose chunker drops a heading that has no body text, whatever the length of the heading.** It also drops any section shorter than 15 characters. Don't leave placeholder headings with no body.

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ## TODO
  ````

- **There is no token-based split inside a section.** An overly long `#`, `##`, or `###` section remains one chunk regardless of size. Keep sections focused; split by topic, not by length.

  If a section grows past a few hundred words, break it into sibling `###` sections by sub-topic rather than letting it balloon.

## Prose Sections

- **Write sections that stand alone.** Each `##`/`###` chunk will be retrieved on its own with no surrounding context. Don't use pronouns or references that depend on the previous section.

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ## Configuring timeouts

  As mentioned above, the tool described earlier reads these values
  from the same file.
  ````

  Good:

  ````md
  ## Configuring timeouts

  The OpenCrane CLI reads `request_timeout_ms` and `connect_timeout_ms`
  from `.opencrane/config.yaml` on every invocation.
  ````

- **Put the key phrasing in the first sentence.** The MCP server supports three search modes — keyword (BM25), semantic (vector), and hybrid. BM25 is position-agnostic: it only cares whether a term appears in the chunk, not where, so first-sentence placement doesn't change keyword results. For semantic and hybrid search, a chunk focused on one clear concept is more likely to match a focused query than one that mixes the topic with preamble. Stating the topic up front also makes chunks easier to evaluate in search results regardless of mode.

  Good:

  ````md
  ### Hybrid search scoring

  OpenCrane blends vector cosine similarity and BM25 using
  `HYBRID_ALPHA * vector + (1 - HYBRID_ALPHA) * BM25`.
  ````

  Avoid (buries the topic):

  ````md
  ### Hybrid search scoring

  There are several ways to score search results. Some systems use
  only vectors, others only BM25. OpenCrane blends both…
  ````

- **Include concrete terms a user would search for** (product names, command names, error strings, config keys). Avoid vague referents when a noun would do.

  Good: "Run `opencrane build` to execute the full pipeline."

  Avoid: "Run the main command to execute it all."

- **Don't open a section with a URL heading** like `## https://example.com/page Title`. OpenCrane does not remove the URL from every place the heading text appears. The URL can stay in list-item breadcrumbs and in section anchors. If the page has no front matter `title` and the URL heading is its first heading, at any level, the URL also becomes part of the page title in the `llms.txt` index. Keep headings human-readable.

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ## https://docs.example.com/api/auth Authentication
  ````

  Good:

  ````md
  ## Authentication
  ````

## Lists

Every list item, including each nested item, becomes its own chunk, each carrying a `breadcrumb_path` built from the nearest heading ancestry.

- **Every list must appear within a section that has a heading (`##`/`###`).** The breadcrumb attached to each list-item chunk is built from the headings above the list, starting at the page title. Prose between the heading and the list is fine. A list that appears before the first `##` heading, typically at the very top of a file, gets only the page title as its breadcrumb. A code block earlier on the page shortens the breadcrumb: for a list after a code block, the breadcrumb holds only the headings between that code block and the list.

  Good:

  ````md
  ### Supported Embedding Models

  - `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` — default
  - `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` — smaller, faster
  - `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` — legacy
  ````

  Avoid (no section heading above, so the items carry only the page title as their breadcrumb):

  ````md
  OpenCrane supports these models:

  - `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
  - `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
  ````

- **Make each item meaningful in isolation.**

  Good: `- Click **Next** to advance the installer to disk selection.`

  Avoid: `- Click Next.`

- **First line first.** The item's first line is what appears in sibling previews (capped at 30 characters, including the ellipsis and, in an ordered list, the item number). Put the key phrase at the start; push explanation to continuation lines or nested bullets.

  Good:

  ````md
  - **Retry policy** — governs behavior on transient 5xx responses.
    Default is three retries with exponential backoff starting at 500ms.
  ````

  Avoid (key phrase arrives late, preview shows filler):

  ````md
  - Something you might want to tune is the retry policy, which governs…
  ````

- **Prefer nesting for real hierarchy, not visual indent.** Nested items inherit their ancestors' first lines as a content prefix, which keeps the chunk self-contained. If the nested bullets aren't logically children of the parent, use a paragraph or a separate list instead.

  Good:

  ````md
  - **Chunking strategies**
    - Prose — splits at heading boundaries
    - Code — one chunk per fenced block
    - List — one chunk per list item
  ````

  Avoid (nested items are unrelated to parent):

  ````md
  - **Chunking strategies**
    - See also: MCP server
    - Contact: support@example.com
  ````

- **Keep top-level lists short — aim for 5–8 items, hard limit 15.** Each list-item chunk carries `sibling_previews` — short text previews of every other item in the same list. Every retrieved chunk brings all those previews with it. A 15-item list means 14 preview strings riding along with every single result, which is token overhead that scales with list length. A chunk shows at most 15 sibling previews. In a list of more than 16 items, OpenCrane replaces the rest with `... +N more` with no text, so the agent can no longer reconstruct the full list from a single chunk without additional search calls.

  If a list is growing past 8 items, ask whether the items naturally group into sub-topics. If so, split under `###` sub-sections with shorter lists under each — better retrieval and less per-chunk overhead.

  If you have more than 15 items, split by sub-topic with `###` sub-sections, each containing a shorter list.

- **Don't interleave prose paragraphs between list items.** Keep descriptive prose above or below the list, not between bullets — it can break list detection and produce odd prose chunks.

  Avoid:

  ````md
  - First step: install the CLI.

  Some background on why this matters…

  - Second step: run `opencrane init`.
  ````

  Good:

  ````md
  Install the CLI first, then initialize the project.

  - First step: install the CLI.
  - Second step: run `opencrane init`.
  ````

- **Use markers consistently at the same indent level.** Mixing `1.` and `-` at the same level in one list is confusing style. Mixing across levels is fine and expected — ordered top-level steps with unordered nested sub-options is a normal pattern and the chunker handles it correctly (nesting is determined by indentation, not marker type).

  Fine — ordered steps, unordered nested options:

  ````md
  1. Install the CLI.
  2. Choose an output format:
     - JSON
     - YAML
  3. Run `opencrane build`.
  ````

- **Code blocks inside list items become separate chunks.** OpenCrane splits each page at every fenced code block before the list chunker runs. A code block inside a list item becomes its own `code_snippet` chunk, and that chunk has no heading breadcrumb. The list items after the code block lose their breadcrumb, because the breadcrumb holds only the headings between the most recent code block and the list.

  This example produces **4 chunks**:

  ````md
  1. Install the CLI:
     ```bash
     pip install opencrane
     ```
  2. Initialise the project:
     ```bash
     opencrane init
     ```
  ````

  Chunk 1 content: `1. Install the CLI:`, with the breadcrumb of its section.
  Chunk 2 content: the `pip install opencrane` block.
  Chunk 3 content: `2. Initialise the project:`, with an empty breadcrumb.
  Chunk 4 content: the `opencrane init` block.

  Put each step that needs a code block under its own heading instead, and introduce the code block with a sentence. The prose chunk of each step then carries the page title and the step heading in its breadcrumb:

  ````md
  ## Install the CLI

  Run the following command to install the CLI:

  ```bash
  pip install opencrane
  ```

  ## Initialize the project

  Run the following command to initialize the project:

  ```bash
  opencrane init
  ```
  ````

  If a list follows a code block, put a heading between them. The list items then carry that heading as their breadcrumb.

## Tables

Every data row of a markdown table becomes its own chunk, rendered as natural-language `Column: value.` lines so it embeds like a sentence. Each row chunk carries a `breadcrumb_path` from the nearest heading ancestry and the table's lead-in sentence, and links to its siblings via `table_id` and `sibling_ids`.

- **Give the table a heading and a lead-in sentence.** The heading builds the breadcrumb; the last non-blank line before the table becomes the caption included in every row chunk. Both make each row retrievable on its own.

  Good:

  ````md
  ### DIAMETER AVP types

  The following AVP types from the base 3GPP Diameter dictionary are used:

  | AVP | Code | Type |
  |-----|------|------|
  | 3GPP-IMSI | 1 | UTF8String |
  | 3GPP-Charging-Id | 2 | Unsigned32 |
  ````

  Each row chunk reads like: `# DIAMETER AVP types` / `The following AVP types from the base 3GPP Diameter dictionary are used:` / `AVP: 3GPP-IMSI.` / `Code: 1.` / `Type: UTF8String.`

- **Put the identifying value in the first column.** The first column is the row's `row_key` and drives sibling previews (capped at 30 characters, including the ellipsis), so lead with the name or key, not a description.

- **Give every column a header.** Cells are rendered as `Header: value.`; a blank header produces an unlabeled `: value.` line that reads poorly.

- **Keep tables out of code fences.** A table inside a ``` fence is treated as code, not chunked into rows. A row-like line followed only by a separator (no data rows) is not a real table and falls through to prose.

## Fenced Code Blocks

- **Always label the language** after the opening fence. Unlabeled blocks are tagged `language: unknown`, which breaks language-filtered retrieval. OpenCrane also never parses an unlabeled block as YAML, so a CRD, OpenAPI spec, or JSON Schema in it gets no per-property chunks.

  Good:

  ````md
  ```python
  from opencrane import OpenCrane
  ```
  ````

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ```
  from opencrane import OpenCrane
  ```
  ````

- **One concept per fenced block.** Each fence becomes one chunk. Don't concatenate a config example and an unrelated error trace in the same fence.

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  # config.yaml
  embedding_model: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5

  # error seen when misconfigured:
  # RuntimeError: model not found
  ```
  ````

  Good — two separate fences:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  embedding_model: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5
  ```

  If the model is missing you will see:

  ```text
  RuntimeError: model not found
  ```
  ````

- **Keep examples complete and self-sufficient.** Each code fence becomes one chunk. If that chunk contains truncated fields the agent cannot act on it without additional search calls. When showing a large object, pick one of two approaches:

  If the surrounding structure is irrelevant to the point, show only the relevant section and use prose to say where it goes:

  ````md
  Set `branch` under your source entry in `.opencrane/config.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  branch: main
  ```
  ````

  If the structure context matters, show the path from the top of the object down to the field, and leave out the sibling fields. Do not mark the omission with a comment. OpenCrane parses the block as YAML and stores it without comments, so the chunk does not show that anything is missing:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  sources:
    my-repo:
      branch: main
  ```
  ````

  Avoid a literal `...`. It is not valid YAML, so a reader who copies the block gets a parse error. OpenCrane keeps the block as plain code instead of parsing it as YAML:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  sources:
    my-repo:
      ...
      branch: main
  ```
  ````

  Good:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  sources:
    - type: github
      repo: example/docs
      branch: main
  ```
  ````

  Avoid:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  sources:
    - type: github
      ...
  ```
  ````

- **Prose-heavy pages stay prose.** The code chunker only claims a node if more than half its lines are code (or the node is under 50 lines). In ordinary markdown docs each fenced block is its own node, so this is rarely an issue — just don't write one giant document that is mostly code fences with occasional paragraphs if you want the prose chunks to survive.

## Embedded Specs (CRD / OpenAPI / JSON Schema)

Fenced YAML blocks are inspected by the chunker. If the YAML parses to a known structured type, a tree walker replaces the single-block chunk with rich per-property chunks.

- **For Kubernetes CRDs:** paste the real spec — `apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/...`, `kind: CustomResourceDefinition`, full `spec.versions[].schema.openAPIV3Schema`. The tree walker completely replaces the raw YAML chunk — the original code block produces no chunk of its own. Only `spec.properties` produces chunks, but the CRD identity is not lost: every property chunk carries `crd_kind` (from `spec.names.kind`), `crd_api_version` (from `spec.group` + version), `crd_version`, and `crd_property_path` as metadata. The agent can filter and group results by kind and API version. What is intentionally skipped: `status` (runtime state, not user-configurable) and `metadata.name` (the full CRD name like `databases.example.com`, though `crd_kind` + `crd_api_version` together convey the same identity).

  Good — produces one chunk per spec property:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
  kind: CustomResourceDefinition
  metadata:
    name: databases.example.com
  spec:
    group: example.com
    names:
      kind: Database
    versions:
      - name: v1
        schema:
          openAPIV3Schema:
            properties:
              spec:
                properties:
                  engine:
                    type: string
                    description: Database engine (postgres, mysql).
                  size:
                    type: string
                    description: Persistent volume size, e.g. "10Gi".
  ```
  ````

- **For OpenAPI specs:** include real `info`, `servers`, `paths`, and `components`. Each operation (`paths.<path>.<method>`) and each named component becomes its own chunk. Write meaningful `summary` and `description` on every operation — they are the retrieval signal.

  Good:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.3
  info:
    title: Example API
    version: 1.0.0
  paths:
    /users/{id}:
      get:
        summary: Fetch a user by ID
        description: Returns the full user record including profile data.
        parameters:
          - name: id
            in: path
            required: true
            schema: { type: string }
  ```
  ````

  Avoid (empty `summary`/`description` — retrieval can't rank the operation):

  ````md
  ```yaml
  paths:
    /users/{id}:
      get:
        summary: ""
        responses: { "200": { description: "" } }
  ```
  ````

- **For JSON Schema:** populate `title` and `description` at the root and on each property. A schema with empty or generic descriptions produces low-quality chunks.

  Good:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  $schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
  title: OpenCrane Source
  description: A single documentation source definition.
  properties:
    type:
      type: string
      description: Source kind — either "github" or "llmstxt".
    repo:
      type: string
      description: GitHub "owner/name" — required when type is "github".
  ```
  ````

- **Properties under 800 tokens are emitted as one chunk. Properties over 800 tokens with nested `properties` or `items.properties` are recursed into — each child becomes its own chunk instead.** The split property gets no chunk of its own, so its own `description` and `type` do not appear in any chunk. Put the information a reader needs on the child properties. Every child chunk carries `logical_parent` (the parent's path), `neighbor_chunks` (sibling IDs), and the full dot-notation path of the property: `crd_property_path` on CRD chunks, for example `spec.config.database`, and `property_path` on JSON Schema and OpenAPI chunks. An agent can navigate the schema tree from any child chunk. The thresholds are hardcoded — there is no config knob. In a JSON Schema, you can also move a large property into a named definition under `$defs` and reference it with `$ref`. The walker chunks each definition separately. Kubernetes CRD schemas do not support `$ref`.

  Good:

  ````md
  ```yaml
  properties:
    database:
      $ref: "#/$defs/DatabaseConfig"
  $defs:
    DatabaseConfig:
      type: object
      description: Database connection configuration.
      properties: { ... }
  ```
  ````

## YAML Front Matter

- **Front matter is ignored by chunking**, but its `title` is used for the page title. The `llms` step strips a `---`-delimited YAML block at the top of a file before the content reaches chunking. When a `title` field is present, it becomes the page title used in the `llms.txt` index. OpenCrane adds a `# {title}` heading at the top of the page in `llms-full.txt`, unless the page already starts with exactly that heading. An existing H1 with different text stays under the new one, so the page then has two H1 headings. Make the body H1 match `title` exactly, or leave the H1 out. The `title` field takes precedence over the first body heading and the filename. See [Generating bundles](llms-generation.md#page-titles).

  Skipped as front matter (its `title` becomes the page title):

  ````md
  ---
  title: Getting Started
  slug: getting-started
  author: Lukasz
  date: 2026-04-01
  ---
  ````

- **Don't hide retrievable content in front matter.** Keep body content in the markdown body.

  Avoid (OpenCrane discards every front matter field except `title`, so search never retrieves the description):

  ````md
  ---
  title: Getting Started
  description: >
    OpenCrane is a standalone RAG pipeline that fetches docs from GitHub,
    generates llms-full.txt bundles, chunks and embeds them, and serves
    them via MCP.
  ---
  ````

  Good — keep a short slug in front matter, put the real description in the body:

  ````md
  ---
  title: Getting Started
  ---

  # Getting Started

  OpenCrane is a standalone RAG pipeline that fetches docs from GitHub,
  generates llms-full.txt bundles, chunks and embeds them, and serves
  them via MCP.
  ````

- **Front matter must be valid YAML.** The `llms` step strips any front matter that parses as a YAML mapping, including mappings whose values are lists or nested maps. If the block is not valid YAML, OpenCrane keeps the whole block in the page body, and it ends up in the chunks.

  Kept in the body, because the unquoted colon in the `title` value is not valid YAML:

  ````md
  ---
  title: Setup: the first run
  ---
  ````

  Stripped as front matter, because the quoted value is valid YAML:

  ````md
  ---
  title: "Setup: the first run"
  ---
  ````
