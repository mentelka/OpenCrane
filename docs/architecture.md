# OpenCrane architecture

OpenCrane is a command-line tool that builds and runs an AI-powered documentation search pipeline. It ingests documentation from GitHub repositories, local directories, and existing `llms-full.txt` files, processes it into typed semantic chunks, generates vector embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that AI assistants can query.

## Typical role

OpenCrane is typically deployed as the documentation search service that AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients) query for component specifications, Custom Resource Definition (CRD) references, and operational guides. When an engineer asks the assistant a question about a documented component, the assistant calls OpenCrane's `search_docs` tool to retrieve the relevant documentation chunks and return them as context.

The tool is open-source (Apache 2.0) and platform-agnostic. It can run as a containerized service or locally via stdio, and has no dependency on any specific platform or infrastructure.

## Pipeline overview

OpenCrane organizes work into stages, and each stage has its own CLI subcommand. You can run each stage on its own, or run the stages from `fetch` to `index` in sequence with `opencrane build`.

```
GitHub repositories
      ↓  add / fetch
.opencrane/sources/
      ↓  llms
.opencrane/llmstxt/  (hierarchical llms-full.txt bundles + companion llms.txt index)
      ↓  chunk
.opencrane/chunks.json
      ↓  embed
.opencrane/embeddings.json
      ↓  index
.opencrane/milvus.db  (or Milvus Server)
      ↓  serve
MCP server — stdio or HTTP
```

### Add sources

The `opencrane add` command registers documentation sources in `.opencrane/config.yaml`. Each source is either a GitHub repository or a pre-existing `llms-full.txt` file. You can also run `opencrane init` to scaffold a new project and add sources interactively in one step.

### Fetch

The `opencrane fetch` command downloads the documentation files of registered GitHub repositories into `.opencrane/sources/`. It supports two discovery modes:

- **Auto-discovery:** Finds all repositories in a GitHub organization that carry the discovery topic. The topic is `documentation` by default, and the `DOCS_TOPIC` environment variable changes it.
- **Manual:** Uses the list of repositories you defined in `.opencrane/config.yaml`.

> [!CAUTION]
> When a repository loses the discovery topic, `opencrane fetch` removes its entry from the source mapping file. It also deletes its source directory and its generated `llmstxt/` output. To keep the source, set `manual: true` on its entry before you run the fetch.

The command fetches repositories concurrently. It auto-removes stale sources (repositories that lost the discovery topic) unless you mark the source `manual: true` in the configuration. Sources marked `local: true` are never fetched — OpenCrane uses them as-is from the local file system.

### Generate `llms-full.txt` bundles

The `opencrane llms` command flattens the fetched Markdown files into a hierarchy of `llms-full.txt` bundles under `.opencrane/llmstxt/`: a top-level combined bundle, a bundle for each source, and a bundle for each path in the source mapping file. When the source mapping file lists no sources, it writes a bundle for each project directory and each subproject directory instead. For each bundle it:

- Processes Markdown files recursively.
- Emits **clean** content — no URLs are injected into headings.
- Adds separators (a `<!-- opencrane:page -->` sentinel between files within a source, `======` between sources) and adds a `# {title}` heading at the start of each page, unless the page already starts with exactly that heading (title precedence: frontmatter `title` → first heading → filename). An existing H1 with different text stays under the new heading, so the page then has two H1 headings. The page separator is a collision-proof HTML comment so markdown thematic breaks (`---`) in content are not mistaken for page boundaries.
- Rewrites relative links to work in the flattened output.
- Invokes fence type handlers for structured content such as OpenAPI specs and Kubernetes CRDs embedded as fenced code blocks.
- Writes a companion `llms.txt` index next to each `llms-full.txt`: a `# {project}` H1 with one `## {source}` section per source and a `- [title](page_url)` link per page, in the same order as the bundle. This index is how the `chunk` step recovers each chunk's specific page `source_url`. For external `llmstxt` sources, a fetched companion `llms.txt` (real per-page URLs) is merged, or an index is synthesized from the source's `docs_url` when no companion exists.

### Chunk

The `opencrane chunk` command splits each `llms-full.txt` bundle into typed semantic chunks and writes them to `.opencrane/chunks.json`. It reads the companion `llms.txt` index alongside the bundle and assigns each chunk its specific page `source_url` by joining the clean content to the index positionally per source, validated by the page's H1 title (falling back to the legacy inline-marker path when no companion index is present). Chunking strategies run in priority order — the first strategy that matches a document fragment handles it:

1. **YAML strategy:** Handles YAML content. Delegates structured specs (CRDs, OpenAPI, JSON Schema) to tree walkers. Falls back to a generic `yaml_content` chunk for unrecognized YAML.
2. **Code strategy:** Handles fenced code blocks. Detects the language and, for structured YAML specs embedded in code fences, invokes tree walkers.
3. **Table strategy:** Handles Markdown tables. Produces one `table_row` chunk per data row, rendered as natural-language `Column: value.` lines and self-linked via `table_id` and `sibling_ids`. Delegates non-table regions to the list and prose strategies.
4. **List strategy:** Handles Markdown lists. Produces one chunk per top-level list item and attaches sibling previews and breadcrumb paths.
5. **Prose strategy:** The fallback. Splits at heading boundaries (`#`, `##`, `###`). Preserves complete sections — does not split within a section by token count.

Each chunk carries a `chunk_type` field (`prose`, `code_snippet`, `crd_definition`, `openapi_spec`, `json_schema`, `yaml_content`, `list_item`, or `table_row`) and type-specific metadata fields. See [Chunk metadata schema](metadata-schema.md) for the full field reference.

### Embed

The `opencrane embed` command generates a vector embedding for each chunk in `.opencrane/chunks.json` and writes the results to `.opencrane/embeddings.json`. It uses the `sentence-transformers` library with `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` as the default model. You can change the model via the `EMBEDDING_MODEL` environment variable. The command processes chunks in batches to manage memory.

### Index

The `opencrane index` command loads `.opencrane/embeddings.json` into a Milvus vector database. It creates a collection with a vector index on the embeddings (cosine similarity as the distance metric) and `INVERTED` scalar indexes on the `list_id` and `table_id` columns, so `get_list_members` and `get_table_members` are served by an indexed lookup rather than an in-memory scan of the corpus. `INVERTED` is used rather than `AUTOINDEX` because Milvus Lite accepts `AUTOINDEX` only on vector fields.

Because `list_id` and `table_id` are dedicated columns, a collection built by an older OpenCrane version that predates them is dropped and rebuilt automatically on the next `index` run (a one-time re-index on upgrade, surfaced in the logs).

Two deployment modes are available:

- **Milvus Lite:** An embedded, file-based database stored at `.opencrane/milvus.db`. No separate service is needed. This is the default mode. To store the file somewhere else, set `MILVUS_DB_PATH`.
- **Milvus Server:** A separate Milvus instance. To connect, set `MILVUS_DB_PATH` to an empty value, and set `MILVUS_HOST` and `MILVUS_PORT`.

### Serve

The `opencrane serve` command starts the MCP server backed by the indexed data. Two transport modes are available:

- **stdio:** For local MCP clients such as Claude Code or Cursor.
- **HTTP:** For containerized or remote deployments. The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` generated by `opencrane init` use this mode.

## MCP tools

The tools the server exposes depend on the content of the index. `search_docs` and `health` are always present. The other tools appear only when the index contains the chunk types they work with, as the following table shows:

| Tool | Condition | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `search_docs` | Always present | Hybrid semantic and keyword search across all indexed chunks |
| `get_yaml_definition` | YAML chunks indexed | Retrieve a complete YAML document by chunk ID, with breadcrumb comments showing its location |
| `get_metadata_schema` | YAML, list, or table row chunks indexed | Reference documentation for all chunk metadata fields |
| `get_list_members` | List chunks indexed | Retrieve all items in a list by list ID |
| `get_table_members` | Table row chunks indexed | Retrieve all rows of a table by table ID |
| `health` | Always present | Service status, Milvus connection state, and collection stats |

### Search modes

`search_docs` supports three search modes via the **search_mode** parameter: `semantic`, `keyword`, and `hybrid`. The default is `hybrid`, which blends vector similarity with BM25 keyword scoring:

```
final_score = alpha × vector_score + (1 − alpha) × bm25_score
```

The default **alpha** is `0.6` (60% semantic, 40% keyword). You can override it per query via the **alpha** parameter, or set a default with the `HYBRID_ALPHA` environment variable.

Additional `search_docs` parameters let you filter results by **chunk_types**, **source_names**, and **metadata_contains**, which is useful when you want to restrict a search to a specific documentation source or chunk type.

## Internal components

### CLI (`opencrane/cli.py`)

All subcommands share the same configuration resolution order:

1. Explicit `--config` flag.
2. `OPENCRANE_CONFIG` environment variable.
3. The file that the `extensions` key in `.opencrane/config.yaml` names, relative to `.opencrane/`.
4. Base `OpenCraneConfig` defaults.

When `.opencrane/config.yaml` has an `extensions` key, for example `extensions: extensions.py`, the CLI loads the `OpenCraneConfig` subclass named `Config` from that file. The `opencrane init` template ships this key commented out. This is the primary extension mechanism — subclassing `OpenCraneConfig` lets you override fence types, chunking strategies, and YAML tree walkers without modifying OpenCrane's core.

### RAG pipeline (`opencrane/rag/`)

This package contains the implementation of all pipeline stages. The key modules are:

- **`opencrane/rag/fetch_docs.py`** — GitHub repository fetching, source discovery, and stale-source cleanup.
- **`opencrane/rag/generate_llms_txt.py`** — `llms-full.txt` bundle generation, companion `llms.txt` index emission, fence type dispatch, and link rewriting.
- **`opencrane/rag/services/llms_index.py`** — parses and renders the `llms.txt` index (`LlmsIndex`, `render_llms_txt`) used to join clean content to per-page URLs.
- **`opencrane/rag/chunker.py`** — Top-level chunking orchestration. Loads bundles, resolves source names, and writes `chunks.json`.
- **`opencrane/rag/services/file_processor.py`** — Strategy-pattern chunking. Evaluates strategies in order; the first match handles the fragment.
- **`opencrane/rag/generate_embeddings.py`** — Batch embedding generation.
- **`opencrane/rag/services/source_mapping.py`** — Reads the source mapping file (`.opencrane/config.yaml` by default) and resolves source URLs to source names.

Tree walkers live in `opencrane/rag/services/chunking_strategies/` and handle structured YAML documents:

- **`k8s_crd_tree_walker.py`** — Kubernetes CRD chunking. Produces one chunk per `spec.properties` field and recursively splits nested properties that exceed 800 tokens.
- **`openapi_tree_walker.py`** — OpenAPI 3.x spec chunking. Produces one chunk for `info`, one for each server, one for each operation (path and method), and one for each item under `components`. `security` and `tags` get a chunk each. A schema over 800 tokens splits into chunks for its properties.
- **`json_schema_tree_walker.py`** — JSON Schema chunking. Produces one chunk per property, and splits a property that exceeds 800 tokens into chunks for its nested properties.

### MCP server (`opencrane/mcp/`)

With the stdio transport, the server starts its backing services on the first tool call, so startup is fast. The HTTP transport starts them when the server starts. These tools read from the vector database and do not keep an in-memory copy of the chunks:

- `get_yaml_definition` fetches a single chunk by its primary key.
- `get_list_members` and `get_table_members` query the indexed `list_id` / `table_id` columns (constrained to the relevant `chunk_type`) for a list's or table's members.
- Semantic search reads `token_count` and each chunk's `source_url` straight from the query result rather than re-deriving them. Keyword and hybrid search also use the in-memory BM25 index described below.

On the first request for the tool list, the server asks Milvus which `chunk_type` values the collection contains, and caches the answer for the life of the process. The query reads only the `chunk_type` field through `query_iterator`, not the chunk content. The tool list then matches the indexed content without a separate file that could get out of sync with the database. The server does not refresh this answer, so restart the server after you re-index. The two backing services are:

- **`opencrane/mcp/services/milvus_client.py`** — Manages the connection to Milvus and runs the vector searches.
- **`opencrane/mcp/services/keyword_search.py`** — Builds a Best Matching 25 (BM25) index lazily from `chunks.json` on the first keyword or hybrid query. This index holds the chunks in memory, so the server needs `chunks.json` for keyword and hybrid search.

### Configuration (`opencrane/config.py`, `opencrane/shared/config.py`)

`OpenCraneConfig` is the base class for all project-level configuration. Its pipeline extension points are the following attributes:

- **`fence_types`** — A dict of fence type handlers. Defaults include OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, CRD, and JSON Schema.
- **`chunking_strategies`** — An ordered list of chunking strategy instances. Evaluated in order; first match wins.
- **`yaml_tree_walkers`** — A list of tree walker classes. Evaluated in the order listed.

`Config` in `opencrane/shared/config.py` is the environment-based runtime configuration. It reads all settings from environment variables at process startup.

## Extension points

You extend OpenCrane with a subclass of `OpenCraneConfig` named `Config` in `.opencrane/extensions.py`. To load the file, set `extensions: extensions.py` in `.opencrane/config.yaml`. This section covers the extension points of the pipeline. For the authentication hooks, see [Authentication & Authorization](auth.md).

### Custom fence types

Fence types handle structured content embedded as fenced code blocks during the `llms` stage. To add a fence type, add an entry to `fence_types` with a `CodeFenceConfig` that names the fence and provides a handler function:

```python
class Config(OpenCraneConfig):
    fence_types = {
        **OpenCraneConfig.fence_types,
        "terraform": CodeFenceConfig(fence_type="terraform", handler=my_handler),
    }
```

The handler signature is:

```python
def my_handler(
    content: str,
    file_path: Path,
    project_dir: Path,
    project_name: str,
) -> str: ...
```

### Custom chunking strategies

To add a chunking strategy, insert it into the `chunking_strategies` list at the priority position you want. The first strategy that matches a fragment handles it — place more specific strategies before more general ones.

```python
class Config(OpenCraneConfig):
    chunking_strategies = [
        YamlChunkingStrategy(),
        MyCustomStrategy(),   # runs before Code, Table, List, and Prose
        CodeChunkingStrategy(),
        TableChunkingStrategy(),
        ListChunkingStrategy(),
        ProseChunkingStrategy(),
    ]
```

### Custom YAML tree walkers

To add a tree walker, append it to `yaml_tree_walkers`. Each walker must implement two methods:

- **`can_handle(cls, doc: dict) -> bool`** — Returns `True` if this walker handles the given YAML document.
- **`walk(self) -> list[Chunk]`** — Returns typed `Chunk` objects for the document.

```python
class TerraformTreeWalker(YamlTreeWalker):
    @classmethod
    def can_handle(cls, doc: dict) -> bool:
        return "terraform" in doc

    def walk(self) -> list[Chunk]:
        ...
```

## Data model

The `Chunk` model (`opencrane/shared/models/chunk.py`) is the core data structure that flows through all pipeline stages:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **chunk_id** | `str` | Deterministic 64-character hex ID, hashed from the chunk content, source file, chunk type, and metadata. Stable across pipeline runs |
| **content** | `str` or `dict` or `list` | String for prose and code; dict or list for YAML |
| **source_file** | `str` | Relative path from the workspace root |
| **source_name** | `str` or `None` | Resolved from **source_url**; `None` if no mapping exists |
| **chunk_type** | `str` | One of the chunk type literals (see the Chunk step above) |
| **metadata** | `dict` | Type-specific metadata fields |
| **token_count** | `int` | Token count using `cl100k_base` encoding |
| **line_start** | `int` or `None` | Reserved for future line-level source tracking; currently always `None` |

`VectorChunk` extends `Chunk` with an `embedding` field (a list of floats) and is used only during the `embed` and `index` stages.
