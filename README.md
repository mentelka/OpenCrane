## Features

- **Flexible RAG pipeline**: run the full flow (fetch → generate llms-full.txt → chunk → embed → index → serve) or use only the steps you need
- **MCP server**: exposes search tools consumable by Claude, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client
- **Extensible**: subclass `OpenCraneConfig` to add custom fence types, chunking strategies, and YAML tree walkers; `openapi`, `asyncapi`, `crd`, and `json-schema` fence types are built in
- **Section anchors**: chunks record a `section_anchor` so citations link straight to the exact doc section (`{source_url}#{section_anchor}`); on by default, style-selectable, and overridable per project
- **CLI**: every pipeline step is a subcommand; works in CI/CD and non-Python projects


## Credits

OpenCrane was born from a real-world use case at [Cennso](https://cennso.com) — building AI-powered search over telco product documentation.

This project stands on the shoulders of some excellent open-source work:

- [Milvus](https://milvus.io) — vector database powering similarity search
- [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling) — document parsing and chunking
- [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net) — embedding generation
- [rank-bm25](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25) — BM25 keyword search that complements vector similarity search
- [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — MCP server standard that makes the search tools consumable by AI clients

## Quick start

Scaffold a new project without installing anything:

```bash
uvx opencrane init
```

This command creates the `.opencrane/` directory with the project configuration and container files, then prompts you to add documentation sources. To build and serve the index, install OpenCrane with the `pipeline` extra as described in [Installation](#installation). Then run `opencrane build` and `opencrane serve`.

## Installation

OpenCrane requires Python 3.11 or later. The base package runs the MCP server on an index that is already built. To build an index with the `fetch`, `llms`, `chunk`, and `embed` steps, or to run `tokens`, install the `pipeline` extra:

```bash
# with pip
pip install 'opencrane[pipeline]'

# with uv
uv pip install 'opencrane[pipeline]'

# with uvx (no install needed)
uvx --from 'opencrane[pipeline]' opencrane {COMMAND}
```

## Usage

### CLI

Commands that show `[--config CLASS]` in their usage line accept `--config myproject.config:MyConfig` to load a custom `OpenCraneConfig` subclass. For `opencrane serve`, the server takes `middleware`, `token_verifier`, and `auth_provider` only from `OPENCRANE_CONFIG` or the `extensions:` key, not from `--config`.

#### `opencrane init` — scaffold a new project

```bash
opencrane init [--podman] [--force] [--no-add] [--extensions]
```

Creates the `.opencrane/` directory with the following files:

| Generated file | Description |
|---|---|
| `.opencrane/config.yaml` | Source mapping and project configuration template with commented remote and local examples |
| `.opencrane/README.md` | Quick reference for the `.opencrane/` directory |
| `.opencrane/Dockerfile` | Multi-stage build: deps → model download → Milvus index → runtime |
| `.opencrane/docker-compose.yml` | Builds and runs the MCP server on port 8000 |
| `.opencrane/extensions.py` | Template for custom Python extensions. Generated only with `--extensions` |

> [!CAUTION]
> `--force` replaces `.opencrane/README.md`, the container files, and, with `--extensions`, `.opencrane/extensions.py` with fresh templates, so you lose your changes to them. Commit or back up those files before you run `opencrane init --force`.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--podman` | Generate `.opencrane/Containerfile` instead of `.opencrane/Dockerfile`; README uses `podman` commands |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing generated files (default: skip). `.opencrane/config.yaml` is never overwritten |
| `--no-add` | Skip the interactive source addition prompt (useful for CI/scripts) |
| `--extensions` | Generate `.opencrane/extensions.py` for custom Python extensions |

> **Convention**: OpenCrane loads `.opencrane/extensions.py` as the project extensions config when `.opencrane/config.yaml` has the `extensions: extensions.py` key. The generated `config.yaml` has this key commented out, so uncomment it. The class in the file must be named `Config`. With this key set, you don't need the `--config` flag or the `OPENCRANE_CONFIG` env var.

After scaffolding, `init` prompts you to add documentation sources interactively (same flow as `opencrane add`). Use `--no-add` to skip the prompt.

#### `opencrane add` — add documentation sources

```bash
opencrane add
```

Interactively add documentation sources to your project. The command loops, asking for each source:

1. **GitHub repository** — adds an entry to `.opencrane/config.yaml` with the repo URL, docs path, and optional published docs URL. The `fetch` step downloads its documentation on the next `opencrane build`.
2. **Existing llms.txt file** — provide a URL or local file path. The command adds the entry to `.opencrane/config.yaml`. On the next `fetch`, OpenCrane downloads/copies the file into `.opencrane/llmstxt/<name>/llms-full.txt`, and (when available) fetches the upstream companion `llms.txt` next to it for real per-page source URLs. The `llms` step merges it into the combined index and the `chunk` step assigns per-page `source_url`.

After each source, you're asked whether to add another or finish.

#### `opencrane build` — full pipeline

```bash
opencrane build [--config CLASS] [--sources-dir PATH]... [--llmstxt-dir PATH]
                [--chunks-file PATH] [--embeddings-file PATH]
```

Runs all steps in sequence: fetch → llms → chunk → embed → index.

The index step does not use `--chunks-file` or `--embeddings-file`. It reads the chunks and embeddings from the paths in `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` and `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE`, by default `.opencrane/chunks.json` and `.opencrane/embeddings.json`. To build with other paths, set these environment variables instead of the flags.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--sources-dir PATH` | Source directory to process; repeat for multiple dirs (overrides `AI_DOCS_SOURCES_DIRS` env var) |
| `--llmstxt-dir PATH` | Output directory for llms-full.txt files, and input directory for the chunk step (overrides `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` env var) |
| `--chunks-file PATH` | Output path for chunks JSON, and input for the embed step (overrides `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` env var) |
| `--embeddings-file PATH` | Output path for embeddings JSON (overrides `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE` env var) |

#### `opencrane fetch` — fetch docs from GitHub

```bash
opencrane fetch [--config CLASS] [--org NAME] [--source NAMES]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--org NAME` | GitHub organization to fetch from. Also turns on auto-discovery for that organization (overrides `ORG_NAME` env var) |
| `--source NAMES` | Fetch only these sources, by their path key in `.opencrane/config.yaml`. Takes one name or a comma-separated list, for example `my-repo`. `--repo` is an alias (overrides `FETCH_REPO` env var) |

#### `opencrane llms` — generate llms-full.txt bundles

```bash
opencrane llms [--config CLASS] [--sources-dir PATH]... [--llmstxt-dir PATH] [--force]
```

Emits a clean `llms-full.txt` (no URLs injected into headings) plus a companion `llms.txt` index (page title → page URL) next to it. The `chunk` step reads both to assign each chunk its specific page `source_url`. See [docs/llms-generation.md](docs/llms-generation.md).

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--sources-dir PATH` | Source directory to process; repeat for multiple dirs (overrides `AI_DOCS_SOURCES_DIRS` env var) |
| `--llmstxt-dir PATH` | Output directory for llms-full.txt files (overrides `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` env var) |
| `--force` | Regenerate even if no git changes are detected in the directories passed with `--sources-dir` or set in `AI_DOCS_SOURCES_DIRS`. Without either, the step always regenerates. Git never reports changes in directories it ignores, so pass `--force` for those |

#### `opencrane tokens` — token count report

```bash
opencrane tokens [--source-dir PATH] [--output-file PATH]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--source-dir PATH` | Directory containing llmstxt output to count (overrides `TOKEN_SOURCE_DIR` env var) |
| `--output-file PATH` | Output path for the markdown report (overrides `TOKEN_OUTPUT_FILE` env var) |

#### `opencrane chunk` — chunk docs into .opencrane/chunks.json

```bash
opencrane chunk [--config CLASS] [--llmstxt-dir PATH] [--chunks-file PATH]
```

> Authoring docs that will be chunked? See [docs/authoring-guide.md](docs/authoring-guide.md) for how to structure markdown so chunks are high quality and retrievable.

Reads the companion `llms.txt` index (when present) alongside `llms-full.txt` to assign each chunk its specific page `source_url`; falls back to legacy inline-marker extraction for older bundles without an index.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--llmstxt-dir PATH` | Directory containing llms-full.txt and its companion llms.txt (overrides `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` env var) |
| `--chunks-file PATH` | Output path for chunks JSON (overrides `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` env var) |

#### `opencrane embed` — generate embeddings

```bash
opencrane embed [--config CLASS] [--chunks-file PATH] [--embeddings-file PATH] [--force]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--chunks-file PATH` | Input chunks JSON file (overrides `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` env var) |
| `--embeddings-file PATH` | Output embeddings JSON file (overrides `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE` env var) |
| `--force` | Regenerate the embeddings even if the chunks have not changed since the last run. Without it, the command skips the step when the chunks are unchanged |

#### `opencrane index` — load into Milvus

```bash
opencrane index [--config CLASS]
```

When the Milvus collection already has rows, the command skips indexing and keeps the existing data. This also applies to the index step of `opencrane build`. As a result, after a documentation update, `opencrane build` leaves the old data in Milvus.

> [!CAUTION]
> After an OpenCrane upgrade, `opencrane index` can delete and rebuild the collection. On a Milvus server that an MCP server already uses, searches fail until the rebuild finishes.

When the collection lacks fields that the current version needs, the command drops and rebuilds it automatically.

> [!CAUTION]
> `DROP_EXISTING=true` deletes the Milvus collection before the command rebuilds it. On a Milvus server that an MCP server already uses, searches fail until the rebuild finishes. Before you run the command, confirm that the Milvus variables point to the collection that you want to replace.

To replace the existing data, set `DROP_EXISTING=true`:

```bash
DROP_EXISTING=true opencrane index
```

#### `opencrane serve` — start MCP server

```bash
opencrane serve [--config CLASS] [--transport stdio|http]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--transport stdio` | *(default)* stdio transport for local MCP clients. Prints integration instructions for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Zed, Amazon Q, and Docker/Podman on startup |
| `--transport http` | HTTP transport on port 8000 (Streamable HTTP, stateless). The MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:8000/mcp`. Used inside Docker/Podman containers. Port configurable via `MCP_HTTP_PORT` env var |

##### Health endpoint (`/health`)

The HTTP transport exposes `GET /health` for container liveness/readiness probes (e.g. Cloud Run). It is an **honest, query-aware** check: rather than only confirming that services are wired up, it runs a real one-result search behind a timeout, reports memory headroom from the cgroup, and reports whether the keyword (BM25) search index is already loaded in memory. The overall `status` is the worst of the individual checks:

| `status` | HTTP code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `healthy` | `200` | Serving queries normally |
| `degraded` | `200` | Still serving, but a warning sign is present (slow probe, low memory headroom, or missing collection stats) |
| `unhealthy` | `503` | Cannot serve a query (a service is down or the probe failed/timed out) |
| `initializing` | `503` | Services are still loading at startup |

Example response (`200`):

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "embeddings_service": "healthy",
    "milvus_service": "healthy",
    "collection_stats": { "row_count": 1234 },
    "heavy_maps": {
      "keyword_index_resident": true
    },
    "memory": {
      "source": "cgroup_v2",
      "used_bytes": 536870912,
      "limit_bytes": 2147483648,
      "headroom_pct": 75.0,
      "status": "healthy"
    },
    "query_probe": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "latency_ms": 143.7
    }
  }
}
```

`memory.status` is `unavailable` (and omits the byte fields) when no cgroup memory files can be read, e.g. running outside a container. The same report is returned by the `health` MCP tool. The probe and memory thresholds are tunable — see the [health-check environment variables](#health-check-serve-http-transport).

To deploy the probe, point the platform's liveness/readiness probe at `GET /health` on port 8000. Give the startup/initial-delay enough time for the embedding model to load (until then `/health` returns `503 initializing`), and use a longer liveness period so a real search isn't run every few seconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not bind-mount the Milvus Lite database. Milvus Lite cannot open its `.db` file from a bind-mounted volume and fails with `Open local milvus failed`. Copy the database into the image with `COPY` instead. The generated `.opencrane/Dockerfile` does this in a dedicated build stage.

#### `opencrane pack` — package for distribution

```bash
opencrane pack [--name NAME] [--output PATH] [--version VERSION]
```

Packages the built MCP server and data into a standalone Python package that others can run via `uvx`. After packing, share a one-liner:

```bash
# From PyPI (after publishing)
claude mcp add my-docs -- uvx my-docs-mcp

# From GitHub
claude mcp add my-docs -- uvx --from "git+https://github.com/you/my-docs-mcp" my-docs-mcp

# From local path
claude mcp add my-docs -- uvx --from .opencrane/pack my-docs-mcp
```

The generated package includes the Milvus database and the chunks file — recipients don't need to rebuild anything. The server downloads the embedding model on the first search or `health` call.

Run `opencrane build` before packing. Use `--version` to bump the version when re-packing updated docs (so `uvx` pulls the new version instead of serving its cache).

Install the optional `build` dependency for wheel generation: `pip install 'opencrane[pack]'`.

#### `opencrane inspect` — launch MCP Inspector

```bash
opencrane inspect [--config CLASS]
```

Launches the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) web UI connected to the server via stdio — no Docker required. Requires `npx` (Node.js).

Web UI available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### `opencrane visualize` — see where a paragraph lands in the embedding space

```bash
opencrane visualize --text "your paragraph here"
opencrane visualize --file paragraph.txt
echo "your paragraph" | opencrane visualize
```

Encodes the input paragraph with the same model as the indexed corpus, then renders an interactive HTML with three views side-by-side:

- **Scatter** — global PCA / UMAP / t-SNE projection of the corpus (or of a random sample with `--sample`), with the new paragraph as a highlighted diamond and its top-K neighbors ringed.
- **Local neighborhood** — local PCA on just the paragraph + top-K neighbors. Every point has real coordinates, so distances between *neighbors* also carry meaning.
- **Per-source alignment** — horizontal bar chart of the highest similarity per source repo, with a tick for the mean of its 30 closest chunks, answering "which docs does this paragraph best fit?"

Key flags:

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--method pca\|umap\|tsne` | `umap` | Dimensionality-reduction algorithm |
| `--dim 2\|3` | `3` | Scatter dimensionality |
| `--viz scatter\|neighbors\|sources\|all` | `all` | Which views to render |
| `--sample N` | `0` (full corpus) | Cap the scatter at N randomly-sampled chunks (top-K neighbors always included). Use a smaller N if the browser slows down or UMAP / t-SNE is too slow. Neighbor finding always runs on the full corpus regardless. |
| `--neighbors K` | `12` | Number of nearest neighbors to highlight |
| `--seed N` | `42` | Random seed for sampling and the reducers, for repeatable output |
| `--embeddings-file PATH` | `.opencrane/embeddings.json` | Embeddings to place the paragraph against |
| `--chunks-file PATH` | `.opencrane/chunks.json` | Chunks that match the embeddings |
| `--output PATH` | `.opencrane/visualization.html` | Output HTML path |
| `--no-open` | — | Don't auto-open the HTML in a browser |

Requires the optional `viz` extra: `pip install 'opencrane[viz]'` (adds plotly, scikit-learn, umap-learn).

Useful for:
- **Duplicate detection** — if the top neighbor has very high similarity, you might be writing something that already exists.
- **Which-repo-does-this-belong-to** — the per-source bar chart tells you which docs site has the closest existing content.
- **Sanity-checking new docs** — if neighbors are a random mix of unrelated repos at low similarity, your paragraph is out-of-distribution.

### Default file and directory names

OpenCrane uses these defaults for all pipeline output. Override them with CLI flags (one-off) or environment variables (persistent):

| File / directory | Default | CLI flag | Env var |
|---|---|---|---|
| llms-full.txt output dir | `.opencrane/llmstxt` | `--llmstxt-dir` | `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` |
| Chunks file | `.opencrane/chunks.json` | `--chunks-file` | `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` |
| Embeddings file | `.opencrane/embeddings.json` | `--embeddings-file` | `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE` |
| Token report output | `.opencrane/llmstxt/README.md` | `--output-file` | `TOKEN_OUTPUT_FILE` |
| Source mapping file | `.opencrane/config.yaml` | — | `MAPPING_FILE` |
| Milvus database file (Lite mode) | `.opencrane/milvus.db` | — | `MILVUS_DB_PATH` |

### Environment variables

CLI flags take precedence over environment variables. Use env vars for persistent defaults (e.g. in CI/CD), and flags for one-off overrides.

**`fetch` and `llms` steps** — shared configuration for source tracking:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAPPING_FILE` | `.opencrane/config.yaml` | Path to the source mapping file used by `fetch` (to record fetched repos) and `llms` (to build per-page source URLs in the companion `llms.txt` index) |

**`fetch` step** — only needed if you use `opencrane fetch` to pull docs from GitHub:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ORG_NAME` | `` | GitHub organisation to auto-discover repositories from (see also `--org` flag). Auto-discovery runs only when `AUTO_DISCOVERY_ORGS` also lists the organization. The `--org` flag adds it for you. |
| `FETCH_REPO` | `` | Restrict fetch to one or more sources by path key, comma-separated (see also `--source` flag) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `` | GitHub API token. Required: `opencrane fetch` fails without it. |
| `DOCS_TOPIC` | `documentation` | GitHub topic used to discover repositories automatically within the org |
| `AUTO_DISCOVERY_ORGS` | `` | Whitelist of orgs where topic-based auto-discovery is enabled |
| `TARGET_DIR` | `.opencrane/sources` | Local directory where fetched docs are stored |

**`llms` step** — only needed if you use `opencrane llms` to generate llms-full.txt bundles:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_DOCS_SOURCES_DIRS` | none | Comma-separated list of source directories to process (see also `--sources-dir` flag). When empty, the `llms` step processes the sources listed in the source mapping file |
| `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` | `.opencrane/llmstxt` | Output directory for generated llms-full.txt files (see also `--llmstxt-dir` flag) |

**`tokens` step** — only needed if you use `opencrane tokens`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TOKEN_SOURCE_DIR` | `.opencrane/llmstxt` | Directory containing llmstxt output to count (see also `--source-dir` flag) |
| `TOKEN_OUTPUT_FILE` | `.opencrane/llmstxt/README.md` | Output path for the markdown report (see also `--output-file` flag) |

**`chunk` step** — only needed if you use `opencrane chunk`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_DOCS_LLMSTXT_DIR` | `.opencrane/llmstxt` | Directory containing llms-full.txt (see also `--llmstxt-dir` flag) |
| `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` | `.opencrane/chunks.json` | Output path for the generated chunks (see also `--chunks-file` flag) |

**`embed` step** — only needed if you use `opencrane embed`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` | `.opencrane/chunks.json` | Input chunks JSON file (see also `--chunks-file` flag) |
| `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE` | `.opencrane/embeddings.json` | Output path for the generated embeddings (see also `--embeddings-file` flag) |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` | HuggingFace embedding model to use |

**`index` and `serve` steps** — needed when loading into Milvus or running the MCP server:

OpenCrane supports two Milvus modes. By default it uses **Milvus Lite**, a local database file at `.opencrane/milvus.db` that needs no server. To connect to a **Milvus server** instead, set `MILVUS_DB_PATH` to an empty string and set `MILVUS_HOST` and `MILVUS_PORT`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MILVUS_DB_PATH` | `.opencrane/milvus.db` | Path to the Milvus Lite database file. Set it to an empty string to connect to a Milvus server through `MILVUS_HOST` and `MILVUS_PORT` |
| `MILVUS_HOST` | `localhost` | Milvus server host (server mode only) |
| `MILVUS_PORT` | `19530` | Milvus server port (server mode only) |
| `MILVUS_COLLECTION` | `ai_docs_chunks_v1` | Milvus collection name |
| `AI_DOCS_CHUNKS_FILE` | `.opencrane/chunks.json` | Chunks file that `index` loads and that the MCP server reads for keyword search. `index` reads only this variable, not the `--chunks-file` flag |
| `AI_DOCS_EMBEDDINGS_FILE` | `.opencrane/embeddings.json` | Embeddings file that `index` loads. `index` reads only this variable, not the `--embeddings-file` flag |
| `MILVUS_INSERT_BATCH_SIZE` | `2000` | Max chunks per insert call during `index`. Keeps each call short enough to finish before Milvus keepalive timeouts, which would otherwise trigger client retries that duplicate rows |
| `HYBRID_ALPHA` | `0.6` | Weight of vector search vs keyword search (1.0 = pure vector, 0.0 = pure BM25) |
| `DROP_EXISTING` | `false` | When `true`, `index` deletes and rebuilds the Milvus collection. Without it, `index` skips a collection that already has rows. See [`opencrane index`](#opencrane-index--load-into-milvus) |

#### Health check (`serve`, HTTP transport)

Tune the [`/health`](#health-endpoint-health) probe and thresholds. All optional.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCRANE_HEALTH_PROBE_QUERY` | `documentation` | Query used for the functional search probe |
| `OPENCRANE_HEALTH_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Hard timeout (seconds) for the probe; exceeding it reports `unhealthy` |
| `OPENCRANE_HEALTH_PROBE_BUDGET` | `2` | Soft latency budget (seconds); a slower-but-successful probe reports `degraded` |
| `OPENCRANE_HEALTH_MEM_WARN_HEADROOM` | `0.15` | Minimum free-memory fraction; below it, memory is reported `degraded` |

### Source mapping file (`.opencrane/config.yaml`)

OpenCrane maintains a file called `.opencrane/config.yaml` that records where each documentation source lives and where its content can be found online. It is used by the `fetch` step (to track fetched repos) and by the `llms` step (to build the companion `llms.txt` index of per-page source URLs). The `fetch` step populates it automatically; for manually managed sources you can edit it directly.

Each entry supports the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | Yes (for `fetch`) | GitHub repository URL — used by `opencrane fetch` to download the docs and to build per-page GitHub source URLs in the companion `llms.txt` index |
| `docs_path` | No | Path within the repo where docs are stored (e.g. `docs`) |
| `docs_url` | No | Base URL of the published documentation site (e.g. `https://docs.example.com/product`). When set, per-page URLs are built from it instead of `url` — lets AI agents point users to rendered docs rather than raw GitHub files. For external `llmstxt` sources with no companion `llms.txt`, `docs_url` is used as the base URL for every page in that bundle. If neither is set, chunks from that source get no `source_url`. |
| `manual` | No | When `true`, the entry is user-managed and will not be overwritten by `opencrane fetch` auto-discovery |
| `local` | No | When `true`, the path key points to a local directory in the workspace. `opencrane fetch` skips the entry, and the pipeline reads directly from that path |
| `type` | No | `llmstxt` for an existing `llms-full.txt` file, where `url` is its URL or local path. Default: a GitHub repository |
| `branch` | No | Pin to a specific branch (e.g. `develop`) |
| `tag` | No | Pin to a specific git tag (e.g. `v2.1.0`) |
| `release` | No | Pin to a specific GitHub release by its tag name (e.g. `v2.1.0`) — validated via the Releases API |
| `sha` | No | Pin to a specific commit SHA |

**Ref pinning**: By default, `opencrane fetch` pulls from the latest GitHub release, falling back to the default branch if no releases exist. Use `branch`, `tag`, `release`, or `sha` to pin a source to a specific ref instead. Only one should be set; if multiple are present, priority is `sha` > `tag` > `release` > `branch` (a warning is logged). OpenCrane applies a pin only to entries with `manual: true`. The `opencrane add` command sets this field for you.

Example:

```yaml
sources:
  my-product:
    url: https://github.com/myorg/my-product
    docs_path: docs
    docs_url: https://docs.myorg.com/my-product
    manual: true
    tag: v2.1.0
```

## Extending OpenCrane

Subclass `OpenCraneConfig` to register project-specific extensions:

```python
# myproject/config.py
from opencrane import OpenCraneConfig
from opencrane.fences import CodeFenceConfig, inline_file
from opencrane.rag.services.yaml_chunker import YamlChunkingStrategy
from opencrane.rag.services.code_chunker import CodeChunkingStrategy
from opencrane.rag.services.table_chunker import TableChunkingStrategy
from opencrane.rag.services.list_chunker import ListChunkingStrategy
from opencrane.rag.services.prose_chunker import ProseChunkingStrategy
from myproject.strategies.custom import CustomChunkingStrategy
from myproject.walkers.terraform import TerraformTreeWalker

class MyConfig(OpenCraneConfig):
    fence_types = {
        **OpenCraneConfig.fence_types,  # keep openapi, asyncapi, crd, json-schema
        "terraform": CodeFenceConfig(fence_type="terraform", handler=inline_file),
    }
    chunking_strategies = [
        YamlChunkingStrategy(),
        CustomChunkingStrategy(),
        CodeChunkingStrategy(),
        TableChunkingStrategy(),
        ListChunkingStrategy(),
        ProseChunkingStrategy(),
    ]
    yaml_tree_walkers = [
        *OpenCraneConfig.yaml_tree_walkers,  # keep CRD, OpenAPI, JSON Schema
        TerraformTreeWalker,
    ]
```

Then use it:

```bash
opencrane build --config myproject.config:MyConfig
```

### Extension points

| Extension point | Pipeline step | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `fence_types` | `llms` | Register custom fence language identifiers and control how matching blocks are transformed during llms-full.txt generation |
| `chunking_strategies` | `chunk` | Add or replace chunking strategies for different content types |
| `yaml_tree_walkers` | `chunk` | Add walkers for custom YAML document formats |
| `section_anchor_for` | `chunk` | Build the in-page anchor slug recorded in each chunk's `section_anchor` metadata |

### Section anchors

Each markdown sub-section chunk records a **`section_anchor`** in its metadata — the in-page anchor slug of its nearest section heading (level ≥ 2; the page-title H1 is skipped). `source_url` stays a clean page link, and consumers build a direct section link by joining the two:

```
{source_url}#{section_anchor}
```

For example a chunk under the "Who We Serve" heading of the About page gets `source_url: https://docs.example.com/guide/about` and `section_anchor: who-we-serve`, i.e. `https://docs.example.com/guide/about#who-we-serve`. The `search_docs` results expose it on a `Section Anchor:` line, and `get_metadata_schema` documents it.

**Choosing a style** — set `section_anchor_style` in `.opencrane/config.yaml` (no subclass needed):

```yaml
section_anchor_style: generic   # default — GitBook/GitHub-style slugs
# section_anchor_style: none    # disable section anchors entirely
```

**Writing a custom anchor builder** — when your docs host slugs headings differently, override `section_anchor_for` in your config subclass (`.opencrane/extensions.py:Config`). It receives the nearest heading and returns the fragment slug (no `#`), or `None` to skip:

```python
from opencrane import OpenCraneConfig


class Config(OpenCraneConfig):
    def section_anchor_for(self, heading):
        if not heading:
            return None
        # Example: a host that lowercases and uses underscores instead of hyphens
        return heading.strip().lower().replace(" ", "_")
```

An override takes precedence over `section_anchor_style`.

### Built-in fence types

`openapi`, `asyncapi`, `crd`, and `json-schema` are registered by default in `OpenCraneConfig`. Each uses the `opencrane.fences.inline_file` handler, which reads the file path written inside the fence block, inlines the file content, and adds a `### {source_url}` heading so the chunker assigns a per-file source URL to the resulting chunks.

Usage in markdown:

````markdown
```openapi
path/to/openapi.json
```

```asyncapi
path/to/asyncapi.yaml
```
````

No `extensions.py` is needed for these types. To keep these built-in types when you add your own, pass `**OpenCraneConfig.fence_types` when defining `fence_types` in your config subclass (as shown in the example above).

### Built-in YAML tree walkers

- `K8sCRDTreeWalker` — Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions
- `OpenAPITreeWalker` — OpenAPI 3.x specs
- `JsonSchemaTreeWalker` — JSON Schema documents

### Writing a custom fence type

Register a fence language identifier and provide a `handler` function. When a ` ```my-type ... ``` ` block is encountered during `llms` generation, OpenCrane calls your handler with the raw block content plus the file context, and replaces the block with the returned string.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from opencrane.fences import CodeFenceConfig

def my_handler(content: str, file_path: Path, project_dir: Path, project_name: str) -> str:
    # content      — raw text inside the fence block
    # file_path    — path of the markdown file containing the block
    # project_dir  — root directory of the project being processed
    # project_name — name of the project (used for source URL building)
    # return the full replacement string
    return f"```yaml\n# processed\n{content}\n```\n"

fence_types = {
    "my-type": CodeFenceConfig(fence_type="my-type", handler=my_handler),
}
```

To inline a file referenced by path inside the block, use the built-in `inline_file` handler from `opencrane.fences`:

```python
from opencrane.fences import CodeFenceConfig, inline_file

fence_types = {
    "my-type": CodeFenceConfig(fence_type="my-type", handler=inline_file),
}
```

`inline_file` reads the file path from the fence block content, inlines the file, and adds a `### {source_url}` heading so the chunker assigns per-file source URLs to the resulting chunks.

### Writing a custom YAML tree walker

```python
from opencrane.walkers import YamlTreeWalker

class TerraformTreeWalker(YamlTreeWalker):
    @classmethod
    def can_handle(cls, doc: dict) -> bool:
        return "terraform" in doc

    def walk(self):
        # return List[Chunk]
        ...
```

## Authentication & Authorization

The HTTP transport (`opencrane serve --transport http`) supports OAuth 2.1 authentication and scope-based content authorization. The stdio transport is always open (per the MCP spec).

- **`local` mode** — OpenCrane acts as its own authorization server. When an MCP client starts authorization, OpenCrane redirects the browser to its `/login` form, where the consumer pastes a token or enters a username/password. No external identity provider needed. Configure via `auth.type: local` and set `PUBLIC_URL` + `OPENCRANE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. For a username and password instead of a token, also set `auth.local.method: password` and `OPENCRANE_LOGIN_USER`/`OPENCRANE_LOGIN_PASS`.
- **`oauth` mode** — OpenCrane is an OAuth resource server; token issuance is handled by an external IdP (Keycloak, Auth0, Entra, …). Requires `pip install 'opencrane[auth]'`. Configure via `auth.type: oauth` with `oidc.issuer` and `oidc.audience`, and set `PUBLIC_URL` unless `allow_anonymous` is `true`.
- **Scope-based source gating** — `scope_sources` maps OAuth scopes to sets of documentation sources. Callers only retrieve content from sources their token's scopes permit.
- **`middleware` hook** — for authorization that config cannot express, register a custom ASGI middleware on your `OpenCraneConfig` subclass and call `set_allowed_sources(...)` to declare a request's permitted sources (e.g. resolve them from an external permissions service). Keeps project-specific auth logic out of OpenCrane.
- **`custom` mode** — set `auth.type: custom` and supply your own `token_verifier` or `auth_provider` on `OpenCraneConfig` for full control over token validation or the authorization server. Either hook also needs `PUBLIC_URL`.

See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for the full configuration reference, environment variables, and worked examples (including a complete external-permissions middleware).
