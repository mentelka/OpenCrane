# OpenCrane

A standalone, extensible RAG/MCP pipeline for building AI-powered documentation search. Fetch docs from GitHub, generate `llms-full.txt` bundles, chunk and embed them, index into Milvus, and serve via an MCP server — all from one CLI.

## Commit Rules

- **NEVER include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI co-author attribution in commit messages.** This applies to all commits — no exceptions.
- Keep commit messages concise: `type: short description` (e.g., `feat: add custom walker support`, `fix: token count for empty files`)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `refactor`

## GitHub Actions Conventions

**Always pin GitHub Actions to full commit SHA, not tags or versions.**

```yaml
# Correct:
uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2

# Incorrect:
uses: actions/checkout@v6
uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2
```

Always include the version tag as a comment for reference.

## Tech Stack

- **Python >= 3.11** (uses modern type hints, match statements)
- **CLI**: Click
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2
- **Chunking**: Docling, custom YAML tree walkers
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers (default: `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5`)
- **Vector DB**: Milvus (Lite mode by default, server mode optional)
- **Search**: Hybrid — cosine similarity + BM25 (configurable alpha blend)
- **MCP**: stdio and HTTP transports
- **Tokens**: tiktoken (cl100k_base encoding)

## Pipeline

```
add → fetch → llms → chunk → embed → index → serve
```

- `opencrane add` — interactively add GitHub repos or pre-existing llms.txt files as sources
- `opencrane init` — scaffolds project and offers interactive source addition (same as `add`)
- Each step is independently callable via CLI (`opencrane <step>`) or via `opencrane build` for the full pipeline
- `build` exits gracefully when no sources are configured (suggests `opencrane add`)
- The `llms` step combines pre-existing llms-full.txt files even when `config.yaml` is empty
- The `llms` step also writes a companion `llms.txt` index alongside each `llms-full.txt`; the `chunk` step reads both to assign each chunk its specific page `source_url`

## Development

### Running Tests

**All tests must be run via `./pytest.sh` and not directly with `pytest` or `python -m pytest`.** This is mandatory because `./pytest.sh` sets PYTHONPATH to the project root, ensuring that the pip-installed `opencrane` package is used correctly.

```bash
./pytest.sh                              # All tests, unit and integration
./pytest.sh --check-coverage             # With 100% coverage enforcement
./pytest.sh tests/unit/                  # Unit tests only
./pytest.sh tests/integration/           # Integration tests (needs Milvus Lite)
```

- **100% code coverage is enforced** — `--cov-fail-under=100` in pytest.ini
- Test markers: `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`
- `pytest.ini` deselects integration tests, and `./pytest.sh` selects them again, so `./pytest.sh` with no arguments runs both

### Test Policy

- **NEVER modify, add, or remove tests without explicit user confirmation.** Tests represent the specification of expected behavior — changing them without approval means changing requirements.
- If tests fail during implementation, report failures to the user and request permission before making changes.
- **Test isolation is mandatory**: tests must never touch production files or directories. Always use temp directories and fixture copies. No hardcoded production paths in tests or fixtures.
- Place reusable test assets under `tests/fixtures/`.

### Installing for Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG opencrane chunk
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG opencrane serve
```

## Extension Points

Subclass `OpenCraneConfig` in `.opencrane/extensions.py` to customize:

1. **`fence_types`** — custom fence block handlers for llms-full.txt generation
2. **`chunking_strategies`** — custom chunking strategies (first match wins)
3. **`yaml_tree_walkers`** — custom YAML tree walkers for structured docs (K8s CRD, OpenAPI, JSON Schema built-in)
4. **`section_anchor_for`**: builds the in-page anchor slug recorded on each chunk
5. **`middleware`, `token_verifier`, `auth_provider`**: authentication and authorization hooks for the HTTP transport, see `docs/auth.md`

Config is auto-discovered from `.opencrane/extensions.py:Config` or set via `--config` / `OPENCRANE_CONFIG` env var.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Strategy Pattern** for chunking — extensible without modifying core
- **Milvus Lite by default** — single-file DB, no Docker needed
- **Lazy service init** — MCP server initializes on first search for fast startup
- **Token-based YAML splitting** — recursive split when chunks exceed 800 tokens
- **Hybrid search scoring** — `HYBRID_ALPHA * vector + (1 - HYBRID_ALPHA) * BM25` (default 0.6)
- **Prose chunks split at heading boundaries only** — preserves complete sections for semantic coherence, no token-based splitting within sections
- **MCP server is fully vector-DB-backed** — search, `get_yaml_definition`, `get_list_members`, and `get_table_members` all read from Milvus (chunk lookups by primary key, members by `list_id`/`table_id` scalar columns, `INVERTED`-indexed so lookups don't scan the corpus — `AUTOINDEX` is rejected for scalar fields on Milvus Lite); the server holds no in-memory copy of the corpus. Member queries interpolate a sanitized, width-capped id into the filter (Milvus Lite has no `filter_params` templating). `list_id`/`table_id` are lifted into their own columns at index time; adding them is a schema change, so a collection built by an older version is dropped and rebuilt on the next `index` run
- **Per-page `source_url` via companion `llms.txt`** — `llms-full.txt` stays clean (no URLs injected into headings); each chunk's page URL is recovered by joining the clean content to the standard `llms.txt` index, matched positionally per source and validated by H1 title. External `llmstxt` sources contribute their fetched companion `llms.txt` (real per-page URLs) or a synthesized index from their `docs_url`

## CI/CD

- **test-coverage.yml**: runs on PRs to main, enforces 100% coverage
- **release-please.yml**: on push to `main`, maintains a release PR that computes the next version from conventional commits, writes `CHANGELOG.md` and bumps `pyproject.toml`. Merging it tags and creates the GitHub release. Never hand-edit the version, changelog or tags — release-please owns them, and `.release-please-manifest.json` tracks the current version
- **publish-pypi.yml**: publishes to PyPI on GitHub release (trusted publisher, OIDC). Also runnable manually with a tag input, needed because a release created with the default GITHUB_TOKEN cannot trigger another workflow; setting a `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` PAT removes that step
- Actions pinned by SHA with tag comments
- CI installs `pip install -e '.[dev]'` — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of dependency truth, and the `dev` extra pulls the pipeline, viz and auth deps the full suite needs. It gates on 100% coverage via `./pytest.sh --check-coverage`

## Default Paths

All outputs go to `.opencrane/` directory:
- `.opencrane/sources/` — fetched documentation source files
- `.opencrane/llmstxt/` — generated `llms-full.txt` bundles plus a companion `llms.txt` index (page title → page URL) written next to each `llms-full.txt`
- `.opencrane/chunks.json` — chunked documents
- `.opencrane/embeddings.json` — embedding vectors
- `.opencrane/config.yaml` — source mapping and project configuration
- `.opencrane/milvus.db` — Milvus Lite database

## Documentation Maintenance

When updating documentation, avoid including specific counts or numbers that will quickly become outdated (e.g., "992 chunks", "349 files"). Describe capabilities and structure without hardcoded metrics.
